# Relevant tools, techniques and frameworks
- Jupyter notebook
- scikit-learn

# What I learned
- How to build a Classification Model using the random forest algorithm
- How to use datasets from sklearn
- How to use RandomForestClassifier's fields and functions such as feature_importances_, predict_proba() and score()

# Steps
- Download iris-classification-random-forest.ipynb file on your machine
- Run conda virtual server with 'conda activate base (or your own server name)'
- run 'jupyter notebook' and open the downloaded file
- Select 'Edit > Clear Outputs of All Cells' to clean up outputs
- Run each cell by hitting 'Shift + Enter'
